## Current Development

-   running scSTM_Content_SampleandTime_Prevalence sample n12:47250219

-   running scSTM_Content_SampleandTime_noPrevalence trial n12: 47207188

-   Next step

    -   submit all scSTM_Content_SampleandTime_Prevalence for n12 as a benchmark

    -   run eval with fastTopics and seurat

    -   plot to see if this simulation is good

    -   If good, use estimate effect

## Setup

### Simulation:

This simulation uses batch effect to account for both sample effect and treatment effect.

### scSTM

-   scSTM_Content_Prevalence: The current run cannot be used bc of wrong content/prevalence model
