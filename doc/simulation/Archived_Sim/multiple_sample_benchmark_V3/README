# Current Development
Running scSTM_Content_Batch_Prevalence_Time to see how scSTM perform when use both sampleID and time in Content model. 
Next step is to run 1) n12 and n6 to benchmark
# Setup
Simulation: V3 simulation uses SpatPop and generate batch effect between Timepoints
scSTM_noContent_Prevalance: Completed. Use it to benchmark with other methods, and build estimateEffect
