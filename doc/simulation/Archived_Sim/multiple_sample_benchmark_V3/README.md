## Current Development

Running scSTM_Content_Batch_Prevalence_Time to see how scSTM perform when use both sampleID and time in Content model.

n12: 47178058

n6: 47178105

Next step is to run 1) n12 and n6 to benchmark

## Setup

### Simulation:

V3 simulation uses SpatPop and generate batch effect between Timepoints scSTM

### scSTM

scSTM \_noContent_Prevalance: Completed. Use it to benchmark with other methods, and build estimateEffect
