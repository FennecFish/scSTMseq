## Current Development

-   running sims
-   Next step

    -   submit scSTM with content ~ batchID and prevalance with/without timepoint

    -   run eval with fastTopics and seurat


## Setup

### Simulation:

This simulation uses batch effect to account for both sample effect and treatment effect, but with more samples and cellTypes

### scSTM
